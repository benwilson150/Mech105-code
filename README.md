# Mech105-code
This will be used to store all of the codes I have produced over my time in the Mech 105 course. This will have iterative methods, root finding and slope estimation codes. All of the codes are formed using matlab and should be in .m files. The code contains help to run the functions. Created by Ben Wilson unless otherwise specified during the Spring 2018 semester at CSU 
## Homework 10 
This funciton was used to complete the tenth homework assignment. the goal of this assignement was to find the ammount of oxygen that disassociates at high temperatures. It is unfinished
## Homework 8 
This code is a function that is used to find the third order taylor series expansion and the true percent error. It works as expected 
## Simpson
This function does approximates a value using the simpsons composite rule. It will defer to the trapezodial rule of the number of intervals is not usable. works as expected 
## Daycount
Daycount is a function used to find the number of days that have passed in a year based on what month and day it is. works as expected 
## False Position
This function will be used for root estimation using the false position theorum, this uses a sloped line that connects the two guesses and then reevaluating the formula based on the point found. works as expected 
## Homework 11
This code does the newton raphson method to estimate a slope of a function between two points. I am not the creator of this code but used it to complete a homework assignment. works as expected 
## Homework 12 
This code solves a given matrix using LU factorization. Works as expected 
## Homework 3 
This code will be used to approximate the area of a cylindrical and cone shaped vat of water. This will be based on a float at height h. Works as expected 
## Homework 5
This function will output a matrix where each value is the sum of the value to the left and above it. it requires two inputs the length and height of the matrix. Works as expected 
## Homework 7
This formula will be used to find the machine epsilon on the computer it is run on. Works as expected 
## mech105 HW 1 
This code was used to complete the first homework assignment for mech. It has no comments and should not be used for anything outside of that homework assignment. Works as expected but could be cleaned up
## mech105 HW 2 
This code was used to complete the second homework assignment for mech. It is used to find the charge on an electrical capacitor. It is commented and values could be changed to adapt this. Works as expected 
## Newtons  Method Code
This code is unfinished but would be used to run the newtons method of estimation. Needs work
## Reallife code 1 
This code would be used to determine how laundry should be done based on the amount of clothing you  have to fold. Works as expected
